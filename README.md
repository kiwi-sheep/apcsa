# AP Computer Science A Course RoadMap
These are _most_ of the files from assignments and projects in my APCSA course.

*The APCSA course has all units divided into chapters.*
## Class's Organization System (2024-25)
1. Chapter 1:  
     - Unit 1, 2, & 3  
2. Chapter 2:  
     - Unit 4 & 5  
3. Chapter 3:  
     - Unit 6, 7, & 8  
4. Chapter 4:  
     - Unit 9 & 10  
5. **Final Project: White Tower Project**


## Formatting for Repository
- chapter # = ch# (chapter 1 = _ch1_)

- unit # = u# (unit 3 = _ch1\u3_ )

- subsections of units = sub# (unit 3.6 = _ch1\u3\sub6_)

- assignments are in corresponding sub (assignment DeMorgansLaw = _ch1\u3\sub6\DMLaws_)  

Projects will be located in unit folders as: "*proj[Name]*" (e.g. proj. MadLibs = _ch1\u2\projMadLibs_)
