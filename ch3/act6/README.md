In DeMorgansLaw.java, add the code to validate the first part of De Morgan’s Laws: not (a and b) is the same as (not a) or (not b).
 - Use two if/else statements, one for each expression.
 - Show output to confirm the results.
 - Test for all possible values of a and b (true | true, true | false, false | true, false | false).


Continuing in DeMorgansLaw, add the code to validate the second part of De Morgan’s Laws: not (a or b) is the same as (not a) and (not b).
 - Use two if/else statements, one for each expression.
 - Show output to confirm the results.
 - Test for all possible values of a and b (true | true, true | false, false | true, false | false).


In DeMorgansLawIf.java, reproduce the compound Boolean expressions provided in the code without using logical operators. Instead, use nested if/else statements to duplicate their logic. Note there are two sections to modify, one to reproduce !(a && b) and one to reproduce !(a || b).
- Create truth tables if you find it helpful.
- Test for all possible values of a and b (true | true, true | false, false | true, false | false).


In DeMorgansLawGTLT.java, use De Morgan’s Laws to reproduce the provided if statement, creating a new if statement that uses a logical OR. Test for all combinations of positive, negative, and zero values.

- Comment where short-circuited evaluation could occur and describe how it could occur.

- Find the equivalent compound Boolean expression in one of your truth tables and use it to create the or version.
